# Medicine-Alarm-System
The Medicine Alarm System is a mini project using the LPC2129 microcontroller to remind users to take their medication. It uses a Real-Time Clock (RTC) to trigger audible (buzzer) and visual (LED) alarms at scheduled times. Users can set reminders via keypad and see updates on an LCD display.
